    <h4>
      What is MidSEC?
    </h4>
    <p>
      MidSEC is the name given to the midwater science and engineering community – a collaborative effort between professionals of different backgrounds to address technical challenges in researching the midwater environment. <br>
       <br>
      The midwater is the most expansive ecosystem on Earth, ranging from 200m down to 5km, but remains understudied due to focus on the sea floor’s response to human activity. Difficulties accessing and sampling the midwater environment also pose unique issues which can only be addressed through advances in engineering.  <br>
       <br>
      By bringing together leading minds in oceanic engineering and midwater research, we hope to provide a forum for the sharing and generation of ideas, and a platform to support cooperation between international institutions working to understand this vital ecosystem. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>
      What is the MidSEC Conference?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The 2026 MidSEC Conference is our inaugural attempt to host midwater experts in one location for a week of sharing ideas and building community. The need for such an event was recognized by Karen and Jan after finding the midwater community to be fractured and spread out among events based on unrelated topics. As such, they decided to organise a single event for anyone working in this space to meet others and collaborate, and provide an avenue for early-career researchers to meet like-minded professionals. <br>
      <br>
      The conference is open to any scientists interested in midwater research – whether they be geneticists, biologists, ecologists, or oceanographers – or any students or early-career researchers looking at pursuing this as a field of study. Additionally we welcome any engineers who are interested in tackling the challenges associated with data collection and surveying in the midwater environment.
